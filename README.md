# EVENT GURU

Event Guru is an inter-university event management portal which provides its users, particularly the student community, with a pervasive access to the events happening across multiple university campuses.
Event Guru facilitates its users by providing an all-in-one platform for events at the academia level.

Though facebook has the “Event page” functionality to market an event, Event Guru presents its users with the capability of viewing multiple events of various categories at the same time and surfing through the upcoming events. This website is one of a kind for an amalgam of events of different domains and academic institutions.

Every society in a university will have one focal person with an account on the website. The focal person (also known as admin) will be able to add events on the website and may include description, categories, venue and timings of event. The rating of the organization hosting the event will also be displayed.
